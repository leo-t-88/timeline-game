# Timeline Game

- Rules
"In Timeline, players must place cards depicting historical events, inventions, or discoveries in the correct chronological order on the timeline, aiming to be the first to place all their cards correctly."

``Note :``
- The code was developed with Java 21, so I don't know if it will work with later versions.
- The code/javadoc comments and the game interface are in French.``
